My name's Jake Cleary. I'm a web developer from the Sunny (sometimes) town of Worthing, in Sussex, Uk. I love to build websites and enjoy nothing more than learning new things to do with coding and the surrounding industry. I spend most of my time coding HTML & CSS, but I spend a lot of time arguing with PHP too.

I spend my free time listening to music of all genres, but especially electronic. I’m an occasional gamer with a particular fondness for strategy games including the Civilization series.

I love cinema, my favourite films being the Star Wars trilogy (original of course!), the Dark Knight series, and anything by the Coen brothers.

Anyway, that’s probably enough stuff about me. If you interested in talking about code, or anything really, give me a [shout](mailto:shout@jakecleary.net).
